Functions
---------

CQL supports two main categories of functions:

- The :ref:`scalar functions <scalar-functions>`, which simply take a number of values and produce an output with it.
- The :ref:`aggregate functions <aggregate-functions>`, which are used to aggregate multiple rows of results from a
  ``SELECT`` statement.

.. In both cases, CQL provides a number of native "hard-coded" functions as well as the ability to create new user-defined
.. functions.

.. .. note:: By default, the use of user-defined functions is disabled by default for security concerns (even when
..    enabled, the execution of user-defined functions is sandboxed and a "rogue" function should not be allowed to do
..    evil, but no sandbox is perfect so using user-defined functions is opt-in). See the ``enable_user_defined_functions``
..    in ``scylla.yaml`` to enable them.

.. A function is identifier by its name:

.. .. code-block::
   
   function_name: [ `keyspace_name` '.' ] `name`

Native functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cast
````

Supported starting from Scylla version 2.1 

The ``cast`` function can be used to convert one native datatype to another.

The following table describes the conversions supported by the ``cast`` function. Scylla will silently ignore any cast converting a cast datatype into its own datatype.

=============== =======================================================================================================

The conversions rely strictly on Java's semantics. For example, the double value 1 will be converted to the text value
'1.0'. For instance::

    SELECT avg(cast(count as double)) FROM myTable

Token
`````

The ``token`` function computes a token for a given partition key. The exact signature of the token function
depends on the table concerned and on the partitioner used by the cluster.

The arguments of the ``token`` depend on the type of the partition key columns that are used. The return type depends on
the partitioner in use:

- For Murmur3Partitioner, the return type is ``bigint``.

For instance, in a cluster using the default Murmur3Partitioner, if a table is defined by::

    CREATE TABLE users (
        userid text PRIMARY KEY,
        username text,
    )

The ``token`` function accepts single argument of type ``text`` (in that case, the partition key is ``userid``
(there are no clustering columns, so the partition key is the same as the primary key)), and the return type will be
``bigint``.

Uuid
````
The ``uuid`` function takes no parameters and generates a random type 4 uuid suitable for use in ``INSERT`` or
``UPDATE`` statements.

.. _timeuuid-functions:

.. Timeuuid functions
.. ``````````````````

.. ``now``
.. #######

.. The ``now`` function takes no arguments and generates, on the coordinator node, a new unique timeuuid at the 
.. time the function is invoked. Note that this method is useful for insertion but is largely non-sensical in
.. ``WHERE`` clauses. For instance, a query of the form::

..    SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE t = now()

.. will never return any result by design, since the value returned by ``now()`` is guaranteed to be unique.

.. ``currentTimeUUID`` is an alias of ``now``.

.. ``minTimeuuid`` and ``maxTimeuuid``
.. ###################################

.. The ``minTimeuuid`` (resp. ``maxTimeuuid``) function takes a ``timestamp`` value ``t`` (which can be `either a timestamp
.. or a date string <timestamps>`) and return a *fake* ``timeuuid`` corresponding to the *smallest* (resp. *biggest*)
.. possible ``timeuuid`` having for timestamp ``t``. So for instance::

..     SELECT * FROM myTable
..      WHERE t > maxTimeuuid('2013-01-01 00:05+0000')
..        AND t < minTimeuuid('2013-02-02 10:00+0000')

.. will select all rows where the ``timeuuid`` column ``t`` is strictly older than ``'2013-01-01 00:05+0000'`` but strictly
.. younger than ``'2013-02-02 10:00+0000'``. Please note that ``t >= maxTimeuuid('2013-01-01 00:05+0000')`` would still
.. *not* select a ``timeuuid`` generated exactly at '2013-01-01 00:05+0000' and is essentially equivalent to ``t >
.. maxTimeuuid('2013-01-01 00:05+0000')``.

.. note:: We called the values generated by ``minTimeuuid`` and ``maxTimeuuid`` *fake* UUID because they do no respect
   the Time-Based UUID generation process specified by the `RFC 4122 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt>`__. In
   particular, the value returned by these two methods will not be unique. This means you should only use those methods
   for querying (as in the example above). Inserting the result of those methods is almost certainly *a bad idea*.

Datetime functions
``````````````````

.. versionadded:: 2.3

Retrieving the current date/time
################################

The following functions can be used to retrieve the date/time at the time where the function is invoked:

===================== ===============
Function name         Output type
===================== ===============
``currentTimestamp``  ``timestamp``
``currentDate``       ``date``
``currentTime``       ``time``
``currentTimeUUID``   ``timeUUID``
===================== ===============

For example, to retrieve data up to today, run the following query::

   SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE date >= currentDate()

Time conversion functions
#########################

A number of functions are provided to “convert” a ``timeuuid``, a ``timestamp``, or a ``date`` into another ``native``
type.

===================== =============== ===================================================================
Function name         Input type      Description
===================== =============== ===================================================================
``toDate``            ``timeuuid``    Converts the ``timeuuid`` argument into a ``date`` type
``toDate``            ``timestamp``   Converts the ``timestamp`` argument into a ``date`` type
``toTimestamp``       ``timeuuid``    Converts the ``timeuuid`` argument into a ``timestamp`` type
``toTimestamp``       ``date``        Converts the ``date`` argument into a ``timestamp`` type
``toUnixTimestamp``   ``timeuuid``    Converts the ``timeuuid`` argument into a ``bigInt`` raw value
``toUnixTimestamp``   ``timestamp``   Converts the ``timestamp`` argument into a ``bigInt`` raw value
``toUnixTimestamp``   ``date``        Converts the ``date`` argument into a ``bigInt`` raw value
``dateOf``            ``timeuuid``    Similar to ``toTimestamp(timeuuid)`` (DEPRECATED)
``unixTimestampOf``   ``timeuuid``    Similar to ``toUnixTimestamp(timeuuid)`` (DEPRECATED)
===================== =============== ===================================================================

.. Blob conversion functions
.. `````````````````````````
.. A number of functions are provided to “convert” the native types into binary data (``blob``). For every
.. ``<native-type>`` ``type`` supported by CQL (a notable exceptions is ``blob``, for obvious reasons), the function
.. ``typeAsBlob`` takes a argument of type ``type`` and return it as a ``blob``. Conversely, the function ``blobAsType``
.. takes a 64-bit ``blob`` argument and convert it to a ``bigint`` value. And so for instance, ``bigintAsBlob(3)`` is
.. ``0x0000000000000003`` and ``blobAsBigint(0x0000000000000003)`` is ``3``.

.. _aggregate-functions:

Aggregate functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aggregate functions work on a set of rows. They receive values for each row and return one value for the whole set.

If ``normal`` columns, ``scalar functions``, ``UDT`` fields, ``writetime``, or ``ttl`` are selected together with
aggregate functions, the values returned for them will be the ones of the first row matching the query.

.. note::
    The ``LIMIT`` and ``PER PARTITION LIMIT`` used in the ``SELECT`` query will have no effect if the limit is greater 
    than or equal to 1 because they are applied to the output of the aggregate functions (which return one value for 
    the whole set of rows).


Native aggregates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _count-function:

Count
`````

The ``count`` function can be used to count the rows returned by a query. Example::

    SELECT COUNT (*) FROM plays;
    SELECT COUNT (1) FROM plays;

It also can be used to count the non-null value of a given column::

    SELECT COUNT (scores) FROM plays;

Max and Min
```````````

The ``max`` and ``min`` functions can be used to compute the maximum and the minimum value returned by a query for a
given column. For instance::

    SELECT MIN (players), MAX (players) FROM plays WHERE game = 'quake';

Sum
```

The ``sum`` function can be used, to sum up all the values returned by a query for a given column. For instance::

    SELECT SUM (players) FROM plays;

Avg
```

The ``avg`` function can be used to compute the average of all the values returned by a query for a given column. For
instance::

    SELECT AVG (players) FROM plays;
